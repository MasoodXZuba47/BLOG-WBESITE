    <h2>Welcome to My Blog</h2>
    <p>
        This blog website is created using only HTML and CSS.
        It is simple, clean, and easy to understand for beginners.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here I share my thoughts about learning, technology,
        college life, and self-improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project helped me understand how web pages are connected
        using links and how CSS is shared between pages.
