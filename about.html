    <h2>Why This Blog Was Created</h2>
    <p>
        This blog was created as a college project to learn
        the basics of web development.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML is used to create the structure of the website,
        and CSS is used to design and style the pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website is static, which means it does not use
        any database or backend technology.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main goal of this blog is to keep things simple,
        clear, and easy to understand.
